# Voxel

Core utilities for volumetric medical image analysis, written in pytorch. Voxel provides methods for working with 3D image grid data and triangular meshes with consideration of their representation in a world (or scanner) coordinate system. The toolbox is fully GPU compatible and developed with particular emphasis on its use for deep-learning applications. More documentation to come soon!
